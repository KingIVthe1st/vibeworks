```

**Impact:**

**Impact:**
- Eliminates confusion about business model
- Equal visual treatment = premium positioning

## Strategic Principles Applied

### 1. Dual-Audience Clarity
- Every section addresses both creators AND companies
- Self-segmentation via explicit labels ("For Creators" / "For Companies")
- Equal visual treatment prevents either feeling "second class"
- Parallel structure reduces cognitive load

### 2. Premium Minimalism
- Linear/Stripe-level brevity (no fluff words)
- Confident tone (not arrogant or desperate)
- Specific numbers replace vague claims
- No exclamation points or hype language

### 3. Conversion Psychology
- **Scarcity:** "21 days" creates urgency
- **Social Proof:** "10M+ reach" validates distribution
- **Clarity:** Dual CTAs remove decision paralysis
- **Authority:** "15+ years" establishes expertise

### 4. Benefits Over Features
- "Launch to Millions" not "We have distribution"
- "Turn Content Into Cash" not "AI toolkit"
- "Build Your Confidence" not "Beauty rating platform"
- Every line answers "What's in it for me?"

### 5. Scannability
- 3-5 second comprehension for every section
- Value props: 3-5 words each
- Headlines: 10-15 words max
- Bullets: Scannable with check icons
